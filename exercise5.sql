# Question 1: Output a table that calculates the number of distinct female and male dogs in each breed group of the Dogs table, sorted by the total number of dogs in descending order (the sex/breed_group pair 
# with the greatest number of dogs should have 8466 unique Dog_Guids):
%sql SHOW COLUMNS FROM dogs
%%sql
SELECT gender, breed_group, COUNT(DISTINCT dog_guid) AS NUM_DOG
FROM dogs
GROUP BY gender, breed_group
ORDER BY NUM_DOG DESC


# Question 2: Revise the query your wrote in Question 1 
# so that it uses only numbers in the GROUP BY and ORDER BY fields.
%%sql
SELECT gender, breed_group, COUNT(DISTINCT dog_guid) AS NUM_DOG
FROM dogs
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC

# Question 3: Revise the query your wrote in Question 2 so that it (1) excludes the NULL and empty string entries in the breed_group field, 
# and (2) excludes any groups that don't have at least 1,000 distinct Dog_Guids in them.
%%sql
SELECT gender, breed_group, COUNT(DISTINCT dog_guid) AS NUM_DOG
FROM dogs
WHERE breed_group!="" 
GROUP BY gender, breed_group
HAVING NUM_DOG>=1000
ORDER BY NUM_DOG DESC

## Question 4: Write a query that outputs the average number of tests completed and average mean inter-test-interval for every breed type, 
##sorted by the average number of completed tests in descending order
%%sql
SELECT breed_type, AVG(total_tests_completed) AS TOTAL_TEST, AVG(mean_iti_minutes) AS AvgMeanITI
FROM dogs
GROUP BY breed_group
ORDER BY AVG(total_tests_completed) DESC;

## Question 5: Write a query that outputs the average amount of time it took customers to complete each type of test where any individual reaction times over 6000 hours are excluded and only average reaction 
## times that are greater than 0 are included (your output should end up with 58 rows).
%%sql 
SELECT test_name, AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_time,end_time)) AS Duration
FROM exam_answers
WHERE TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE,start_time,end_time)<=6000
GROUP BY test_name
HAVING Duration>0
ORDER BY Duration desc;

# Question 6: Write a query that outputs the total number of unique User_Guids in each combination of State and ZIP code (postal code) in the United States, sorted first by state name in ascending alphabetical order, and second by total number of unique User_Guids in descending order 
# (your first state should be AE and there should be 5043 rows in total in your output).
%%sql
SELECT state, zip, COUNT(DISTINCT user_guid) AS TOTAL_USER
FROM users
WHERE country = 'US'
GROUP BY state, zip
ORDER BY state ASC, TOTAL_USER DESC

# Question 7: Write a query that outputs the total number of unique User_Guids in each combination of State and ZIP code in the United States that have at least 5 users, sorted first by state name in ascending alphabetical order, and second by total number of unique User_Guids 
# in descending order (your first state/ZIP code combination should be AZ/86303).
%%sql
SELECT state, zip, COUNT(DISTINCT user_guid) AS TOTAL_USER
FROM users
WHERE country = 'US'
GROUP BY state, zip
HAVING TOTAL_USER>5
ORDER BY state ASC, TOTAL_USER DESC
