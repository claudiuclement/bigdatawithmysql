# Question 1: How would you change the title of the "start_time" 
# field in the exam_answers table to "exam start time" in a query output
%%sql
SELECT start_time AS "exam start time"
FROM exam_answers
LIMIT 10

## Question 2: How would you list all the possible combinations of test names and subcategory names 
## in complete_tests table? (If you do not limit your output, you should retrieve 45 possible combinations)
%%sql
SELECT DISTINCT test_name,subcategory_name
FROM complete_tests

## Question 3: Below, try executing a query that would sort the same output as described above 
## by membership_type first in descending order, and state second in ascending order
%%sql
SELECT DISTINCT user_guid, state, membership_type
FROM users
WHERE country="US" AND state IS NOT NULL and membership_type IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY  membership_type DESC, state ASC

## Question 4: How would you get a list of all the subcategories of Dognition tests, in alphabetical order, 
## with no test listed more than once (if you do not limit your output, you should retrieve 16 rows)?
%%sql
SELECT DISTINCT subcategory_name
FROM complete_tests
ORDER BY subcategory_name ASC

## Question 5: How would you create a text file with a list of all the non-United States countries o
## f Dognition customers with no country listed more than once?
non=%sql SELECT DISTINCT country FROM users WHERE country!='US';
non.csv('non_us_countries.csv')

# Question 6: How would you find the User ID, Dog ID, and test name of the first 10 tests 
# to ever be completed in the Dognition database?*
%%sql
SELECT user_guid, dog_guid, test_name
FROM complete_tests
ORDER BY created_at ASC
LIMIT 10;

# Question 7: How would create a text file with a list of all the customers with yearly memberships 
# who live in the state of North Carolina (USA) and joined Dognition after March 1, 2014, sorted so that the most recent member is at the top of the list?
%sql SHOW columns FROM users
member=%%sql SELECT DISTINCT user_guid FROM users WHERE membership_type=2 AND state='NC' AND country='US' AND created_at>'2014-03-01' ORDER BY created_at DESC;
member.csv('NC_yearly_after_March_1_2014.csv')
